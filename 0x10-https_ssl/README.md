			0x10. HTTPS SSL 
In this project we understand how HTTPS works and what is the difference between HTTPS and HTTP. This project comes with two tasks which include:

 0. World wide web - Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01).

 1. HAproxy SSL termination - Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www.
