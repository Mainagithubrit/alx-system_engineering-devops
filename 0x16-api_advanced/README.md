            0x16. API advanced
 * In this project we will be working with reddit API and we have three tasks:
    * 0. How many subs? - a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit.

    * 1. Top Ten - a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

    * 2. Recurse it! - Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit.
